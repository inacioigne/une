The effects of the carbon nanotubes on the physical and mechanical properties of Mg were investigated. The thermo-mechanical property results show an increase in thermal stability with increasing amount of CNTs in the Mg nanocomposites. Mechanical property characterizations reveal an improvement of yield strength, ductility and work of fracture with higher weight percentages of CNTs incorporated. An attempt is made to correlate the physical and mechanical properties with the increasing weight fractions of carbon nanotubes in the pure Mg matrix."
