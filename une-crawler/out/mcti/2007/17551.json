The morphology and the microstructures of as-deposited nanowires were examined by scanning electron microscope, x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and electron diffraction. It is demonstrated that the content of magnetic element Ni in the nanowires can be easily adjusted by changing the ingredients of the electrolyte, the deposited current density and the deposited voltage, which is critical to tune the magnetic property of the nanowires. X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction analysis indicate that the NixZn1-x nanowires exhibit different structures with the variation in the quantity of nickel in the nanowires. It is expected that these heterogeneous alloy nanowires will have a potential application in nanoscale giant-magnetoresistance devices."
