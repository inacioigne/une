This publication sets out the findings of a survey on issues relating to small arms, light weapons and personal security in Sierra Leone conducted in early 2003. The survey results are qualitative, highlighting the experiences and types of security problems people encountered at the time. Findings included the importance of assessments of personal security needs to be taken into account, working in close co-operation with local communities, prior to any project design or planning for a weapons collection programme being undertaken."
