This volume is part of a continuing series of volumes on Coastlines of the World. Some of the topics covered include environmental considerations, engineering and science; data gathering, and monitoring; legal, regulatory, and political aspects of coastal management; planning, conservation, and development; and public information and citizen participation. This volume provides the professionals, decision-makers, and general public with a broad understanding of these subjects as they relate to Coastal Engineering Considerations in Coastal Zone Management."
