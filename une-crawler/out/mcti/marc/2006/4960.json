            "a": "The Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, founded in 1866 with the still-current mission of researching the human and natural richness of the Amazon, was the host institution for the First International Congress of Ethnobiology in 1988, in Belém, and now proudly presents these Proceedings. It is our hope that these pages of combined wisdom and insight provide a guide to future research on the workings of native and folk cultures in the Amazon and throughout the world. The Amazon, even after almost five centuries of exploration, still holds its secrets tightly, and ideas of great potential await like unpicked fruits in an orchard. We must not allow preconceived ideas to impede us from learning the valuable lessons that the Indians and rural caboclos would teach us. North Americans, in particular, need to be reminded that Indian princess Pocahontas (1595-1617) did not teach all she knew to Captain John Smith (nor, for that matter, did she marry him). We should go to where a different world view prevails, where we can test our own assumed cultural superiority. Here, in the Amazon with its myriad challenges, we - as a culture - may well meet our match. I remember fondly my visti in 1987 to the Kayapó Indian village of Gorotire in southern Pará. With museologist Denise Hamú, ethnobiologist Darrell Posey, and entomologist William Overal, I saw a self-reliant people safe-guardian what they knew to have value: their remarkable mastery of nature. How different was this picture from the one usually painted of the Amazon, that of deforested patches reduced to charred embers, a habitat for man and bountiful life pillaged in the name of short-term financial gain. It is our task to fight against the despoiling of nature, but we must remember that neither the sayer nor the chain saw he wields is the enemy. The true enemy of the Amazon is a world economic system that rewards destruction and penalizes conservation. Let us then spirit of science and learning, ask our brethren in the forests, the mountains or wherever they may be, what they can teach us about nature, and let us use their knowledge for the betterment of all mankind."
